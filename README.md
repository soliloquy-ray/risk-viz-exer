Introduction

This is a solution to the problem set stated [here](https://github.com/RiskThinking/work-samples/blob/main/UI-UX-Developer.md)

This is a NextJS application that visualizes risk data using various charts and graphs. The application includes multiple pages, including a dashboard, a map view, and a data table view. The application uses the following technologies:
```
    NextJS: A framework for building server-side rendered React applications.
    React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
    Chart.js: A JavaScript library for creating charts and graphs.
    Mapbox GL JS: A set of APIs for integrating maps into web applications.
    react-data-table-component: A React library for building datatables
```

Getting Started

To run this application locally, you will need Node.js and npm installed on your computer. Once you have installed Node.js and npm, follow these steps:
```
    Clone the repository to your local machine.
    Open a terminal window and navigate to the root directory of the repository.
    Run the command npm install to install the dependencies.
    Run the command npm run dev to start the development server.
    Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to view the application.
```

A tsv file is used to populate the data to be used for this exercise. A `sample.tsv` file exported from the google sheet is included in `src/app`.
